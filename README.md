## Project : Bank Profits and Voter Count
### Program : Python

Overview:
    Banking data summmarized.
    Election winner declared.

Financial records and voter counts gathered and stored in a comma-separated values (.csv) file. With the use of python knowladge each data set was analyzed for the appropriate factors needed to summarize the key take aways. An analysis.csv file is included within each data set's specific folder.

Budget data analyzed for:
 -Net profit.
 -Average change over the entire period.
 -Month with the greatest increase in profit.
 -Month with the greatest decrease in profit. 

Voter data analyzed to find:
-Total number of voters
-Election Candidates
-Percent votes of each candidate
-Total Votes of each candidate
-Overall election winner, by popular vote.

The overall code were both simple to write; however, there was an index error in gathering the total votes for each candidate. To reolve this, a separate loop was created which executed with no problems or issues.
